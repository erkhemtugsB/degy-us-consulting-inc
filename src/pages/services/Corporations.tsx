        International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) Services
      </h1>

      <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
        The International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) simplifies fuel tax reporting for motor carriers operating in multiple U.S. states and Canadian provinces.
        With IFTA, you can file one quarterly fuel tax report covering all member jurisdictions.
        Below is an overview of IFTA, who needs it, and how to register and renew.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What is IFTA?</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        IFTA is an agreement among 48 U.S. states and 10 Canadian provinces that streamlines the process of reporting and paying fuel use taxes.
        Carriers report mileage and fuel purchases to their base jurisdiction, which distributes the taxes to other jurisdictions where you operate.
