        Understanding Employer Identification Numbers (EIN)
      </h1>

      <p className="mb-6">
        An <strong>Employer Identification Number (EIN)</strong>, also known as a Tax ID, FEIN, or Federal ID Number,
        is a unique nine-digit number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to identify a business entity for tax purposes.
        It works much like a Social Security Number for individuals, but is used for businesses.
