        Understanding DOT Numbers
      </h1>

      <p>
        A <strong>DOT Number</strong> (Department of Transportation Number) is a unique identifier issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to companies operating commercial vehicles in interstate commerce. It allows the FMCSA and state agencies to monitor safety records, verify insurance coverage, and ensure compliance with federal regulations.
