        Illinois Intrastate Authority
      </h1>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Intrastate authority is required for businesses operating commercial vehicles solely within the state of Illinois, without crossing state lines.
        If your company transports goods, passengers, or other commodities only within Illinois, you must register with the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) to obtain intrastate authority.
        This ensures compliance with Illinois regulations for in-state commercial vehicle operations.
